        <p>The Airborne detachment of the 212th Attack Battalion is known by the callsign Spectre. 
            Each platoon has a Spectre squad as part of it's composition. Spectre specializes in fast 
            attack, highly mobile infantry gameplay. With their jump packs, Spectre is able to drop 
            behind enemy lines and engage enemies either to the rear or use them to flank positions 
            with their increased speed. Spectre, using their jump packs, is able to close the gap 
            between themselves and the enemy, allowing them to excel in CQC combat environments. 
            They are also able to quickly redeploy to vulnerable flanks.
            <br>
            <br>
            Organizationally, Spectre fall under the infantry structure as "specialized infantry" 
            and are only considered a detachment in the eyes of the Training Department for the 
            purpose of organization within that department.
